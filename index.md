Hi! I am a PhD student at Yale University in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, where I am advised by [Prof. Elisa Celis](https://datascienceethics.org/elisacelis/). Prior to this, I was at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) for two years.

I am interested in problems related to machine learning, algorithmic fairness and social networks. Broadly, I am intrigued by interactions between society and automation and the various questions around the potentially discriminatory impacts of AI applications.

I received my Bachelor and Master degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur under the supervision of [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal).

**I am on the job market for ethical AI positions.**
