Hi! I am a second year PhD student at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, where I am advised by [Prof. Elisa Celis](https://theory.epfl.ch/celis/HOME.html) and [Prof. Nisheeth K. Vishnoi](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi). 

I am interested in problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science. I have worked on or am currently working on problems related to algorithmic fairness, convex and non-convex optimization and neural networks.

Before EPFL, I received my Bachelor and Master degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur under the supervision of [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal).
