Hi! I am a PhD student at Yale University in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, where I am advised by [Prof. Elisa Celis](https://datascienceethics.org/elisacelis/) and [Prof. Nisheeth K. Vishnoi](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi). I was earlier at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) for two years.

I am interested in problems related to machine learning, algorithmic fairness and social networks. I have worked on or am currently working on problems related to fair learning algorithms, convex and non-convex optimization and neural networks.

I received my Bachelor and Master degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur under the supervision of [Prof. Rajat Mittal](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal).
